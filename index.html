  <!--
  Recall in the earlier version of the todo-app the tasks we added were all
  bunched up, that's because we're just adding text in to the container. What we
  actually want to do is add <li> elements like our earlier list. This is a
  little involved and we'll do it with two steps.

  Based on our earlier **model** we want to insert into the DOM a <li> element
  which contains a <label> and <input> checkbox. By adding some classes to our
  document, specifically to the template we can style the todo items, add to
  <li>, <input> elements.  The styling is already setup in the external CSS
  file so we just need to add hooks via the JavaScript to locate and style based
  on classes and weather or not the the checkbox is checked or not!

  First we create a template,  This <script> tag will act as a template for our
  JavaScript. We'll retrieve the content of this script tag and then REPLACE the
  comment sting that says "<!-- TASK_NAME ->" so that it has our tasks name in
  it.  

  Templating is pretty cool.  Notice the the <script> tag is just another HTML5
  element. We can access any element in the DOM tree via Javascript.  So we
  follow our pattern of adding an 'id' attribute, using the attribute to locate
  the element in JavaScript.

  Note:  
    1. the 'id' attribute must occur after the 'type' attribute 
    2. *** THIS 'TEMPLATE' NEEDS TO BE HERE IN THE HTML ***
